curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:8000/user/1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \.
  -d '{
  “name": ”Dol Baeb”

## 📝 Logging

Logs of requests and responses will be written to both the console and the `app.log` file. The log will include:

- 🌍 **IP address of the client**
- 🔄 **Request method** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- 📡 **URL of request**
- ✅❌ **Response Status**
- ⏱️ **Request Processing Time**

In addition, the number of requests from one IP will be tracked (for spam protection). If the number of requests exceeds the specified limit, the server returns error 429 (Too Many Requests).
